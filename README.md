#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage Two**, I created a local Database in order to deal with offline first approach and serve restaurants information even if there is no riliable network connection. Additionally, I've improved accessibility and app performance.
